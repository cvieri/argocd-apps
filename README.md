# Argo CD Applications

## Overview
This repository contains the configuration files for managing applications with Argo CD.

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster installed and configured
- `kubectl` and `argocd` command-line tools installed
- Access to the Argo CD UI or CLI

## Installation and Configuration
1. **Install Argo CD**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#2-install-argo-cd).
2. **Access the Argo CD UI**: Obtain the Argo CD server URL and the initial login password by following the [accessing the Argo CD UI](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#3-access-the-argo-cd-ui) guide.
3. **Log in to Argo CD**: Use the Argo CD CLI or the UI to log in and change the password (optional).

## Usage
1. **Application Configuration**: Each application has its directory containing the configuration files.
2. **Syncing Applications**: Use the Argo CD UI or CLI to sync applications with the configured Git repository.

## Adding a New Application
To add a new application to Argo CD, follow these steps:
1. Create a new directory for the application.
2. Add the necessary configuration files (e.g., `app.yaml`, `values.yaml`).
3. Commit and push the changes to the Git repository.
